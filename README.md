# Yearly-Rainfall-Data-Prediction-On-Historical-Rainfall-Data-of-Dhaka
Here, I used the historical rainfall data of Dhaka from 1970 to 2017 and used the beginner level Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression algorithm into it to predict the rainfall.

I have colleceted the dataset from Kaggle's Yousuf Zaman and reduced the features into one feature. At first I accumulated the whole monthly dataset of Dhaka into yearly dataset. Then the first column of my dataset was years and the second one was yearly rainfall.

The dataset looks like: first column: Years 20xx, 19xx... and the second column, Rainfall in Millimeters1.xxx, 2.xxx...

Then for it, I used the Linear Regression model at first to predict on the dataset and after that I used Polynomial Regression Dataset.

As a programming tool, I have used GNU Octave.
